# Configures the behavior of the script to make it more robust.
# -e Ensures that if a command fails, the script will stop there.
# -u Ensures that if you try to use an undefined or unset variable, the script exits with an error.
# -o pipefail Ensures that in case of a failure in a pipeline, the script will return the exit status of the first failing command in the pipeline instead of just the last one(default behavior).

# [ $? -eq 0 ] here $? is representing the exit status of the last executed command with 0 being success
